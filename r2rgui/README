R2R Graphical User Interface
----------------------------

Introduction:

The R2R Graphical User Interface is a web application that provides a graphical
user interface to the R2R Framework and allows the user to execute vocabulary
mappings on data sources that are either located in a triple store or in RDF
dumps. The main features of the R2R Graphical User Interface are:

- The user may select input data from a SPARQL endpoint as well as from RDF dumps.
- Mappings can be loaded from files and edited in a text-based editor.
- On executing mappings, the translated RDF data can be written to SPARQL/Update endpoints or written to RDF dumps.

Requirements:

- JDK 6 or later
- Play Framework (http://www.playframework.com)

Running the R2R Graphical User Interface:

- navigate to this directory
- execute 'play run'
- Navigate in your browser to http://localhost:9000
